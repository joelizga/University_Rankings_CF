Data and analysis of three world university ranking institutions
Description
The World University Rankings dataset consists of five Excel files were downloaded from Kaggle on World University Rankings, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings. Three of the files contain global university rankings from free sources: Times Higher Education World University Ranking(https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/latest/world-ranking), Academic Ranking of World Universities(https://www.shanghairanking.com/rankings), and the Center for World University Rankings(https://cwur.org/). Each of these sources has their set of potential biases.
The Times Higher Education World University Ranking was founded in the United Kingdom in 2010. While it is highly regarded, criticism has been levied that it is too commercialized and undermines non-English-speaking institutions.
The Academic Ranking of World Universities was founded in China in 2003 and is also highly regarded. It has been criticized for focusing on research and devaluing humanities and instruction quality.
The final source is the Center for World University Rankings, founded in 2012. It comes from Saudia Arabia and is less well known than the other two.
Additionally, there are three supplemental files on educational attainment, national educational expenditures, and national socioeconomic status. The educational attainment data comes from the World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.CUAT.ZS) and comprises information from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics and the Barro-Lee Dataset. The second file compares expenditures on public and private education nationally and comes from the National Center for Education Statistics (https://www.aecf.org/). The final dataset was found on Kaggle for the time series analysis (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sdorius/globses). An individual compiled it from seven different sources. While it is interesting, it may not be as reliable since it is difficult to know if the seven sources used the same criteria.
